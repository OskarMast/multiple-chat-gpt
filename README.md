### What this project is
It's a chat UI for engineers and power users of chatgpt. The philosophy is that every feature should be critical - i.e. there is no button for sending messages because we all send the questions by pressing enter. 
The project should only contain features that are _frequently used_, i.e. first-class support for agents is not relevant since basically no one uses it day to day (for now) to do actual work. 
The project is also meant to only have design that is critical - there should be no message bubbles, no message icons etc.
